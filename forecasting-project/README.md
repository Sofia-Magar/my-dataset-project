# Forecasting Project

This project implements forecasting models using historical data. It includes scripts and notebooks that utilize the Prophet library for time series forecasting.

## Project Structure

- **datasets/dataset_pcs.csv**: Contains the dataset used for forecasting. It includes historical data necessary for training the forecasting models.

- **models/forecast_generator.py**: A Python script that implements a forecasting model using the Prophet library. It loads the dataset, prepares the data, fits the model, generates a 30-day forecast, and saves the results to a CSV file.

- **models/Prophet_pcs.ipynb**: A Jupyter notebook that provides an alternative implementation of the forecasting model using Prophet. It includes data loading, preprocessing, model training, and forecasting for multiple SKUs, along with additional regressors.

- **results/forecast.csv**: Stores the forecast results generated by the forecasting model. It includes the predicted values along with lower and upper confidence intervals.

- **requirements.txt**: Lists the dependencies required for the project, including libraries such as pandas and Prophet.

## Setup Instructions

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Navigate to the project directory.
3. Install the required dependencies using the following command:
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
4. Run the forecasting models by executing the Python script or Jupyter notebook.

## Usage

- To generate a forecast using the Python script, run:
  ```
  python models/forecast_generator.py
  ```

- To use the Jupyter notebook, open `models/Prophet_pcs.ipynb` in a Jupyter environment and execute the cells sequentially.

## Results

The forecast results will be saved in `results/forecast.csv`. This file contains the predicted values along with their confidence intervals.
